# Wikipedia URL Replacer

I got tired of mobile Wikipedia pages displaying on my desktop browser so here's a simple Chrome extension that redirects them automatically.

## Installation
1. Install and compile

```
npm install && npx tsc
```

2. Load the extension in Chrome:
- Open chrome://extensions/.
- Enable Developer mode
- Click Load unpacked and select the project directory

3. Test it out
